## Nomenclature
Daedalus was a skillful Greek architect and craftsman, and was seen as a symbol of wisdom, knowledge, and power. He was famous for his warning to his unheeded warning to his son, "don't fly too close to the sun", reminding us that while blockchain and cryptocurrency has allowed us to soar into much higher heights of technological advancements, we should keep in mind of the potential pitfalls of bleeding edge tech, lest we find ourselves being burnt out by the heat and falling to our demise.
